Notes:
<br/>
Can include screening/testing, sorting, and classifying. Used to identify cells that cannot meet refurbishment or repurposing requirements and to group batteries with similar levels of degradation and electrochemical performance.
<br/>
<br/>
Screening is often done exploratorially on a general sample population whereas testing may be conducted on individual batteries for well-defined purposes.
<br/>
<br/>
Testing includes safety and performance testing. Also referred to as screening. Can include electrochemical, observation, and other advanced testing methods (ultrasound).
<br/>
<br/>
Definitions:
<br/>
Sorting - physical separation or grouping according to defined attributes (i.e., classes). Adapted from ISO 59014:2024(en), 3.20. Sorting can be based on electrical chemical parameters, chemistry, and physical appearance (Rehman, et al., (2024) (see references below).
<br/>
<br/>
Screening  (test)- application of any analytical semi-quantitative method for exploratory analysis. Adapted from ISO 12404:2021(en).
