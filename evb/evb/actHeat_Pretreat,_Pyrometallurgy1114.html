  Description

</p>
Notes:
<br/>
The process may involve roasting, calcination, and sintering. It also includes applying controlled heat and/or specific atmospheric conditions to a material before the main high-temperature extraction process. This approach removes impurities and alters the chemical and physical composition of the feed material, ultimately enhancing the recovery rates of the desired materials.

Definitions:
<br/>
Roasting &ndash; processing of treating (feedstock) at elevated temperatures to obtain oxides. Adapted from ISO 22444-1:2020.
<br/>
<br/>
Calcination &ndash; See A33132
<br/>
<br/>
Sintering &not;&ndash; thermal treatment of a powder or (material), at a temperature below the melting point of the main constituent, for the purpose of increasing its strength by the metallurgical bonding of its particles. Adapted from ISO 3252:2023.
