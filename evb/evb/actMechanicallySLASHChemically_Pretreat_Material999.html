<p class="textfield" id="description"><B>Description </B></p>Notes:<br>This activity is completed to reduce the size and heterogeneity of materials, further sort battery material and cells, or improve the safety state of the material. Can include neutralizing step.<br><br>This often results in the formation of black mass (aka black powder, black sand, etc.), which is material that can undergo hydro- or pyrometallurgical activities.<br><br>Definitions:<br>Feed (stock) – material being supplied to a processing machine.<br><br>Black Mass - shredded battery material.<br><br>Pre-treatment - activity (e.g. drying, grinding, grading) applied to a material before it enters the main treatment process.
