<p class="textfield" id="description"><B>Description </B></p>Notes:<br>The process may involve roasting, calcination, and sintering. It also includes applying controlled heat and/or specific atmospheric conditions to a material before the main high-temperature extraction process. This approach removes impurities and alters the chemical and physical composition of the feed material, ultimately enhancing the recovery rates of the desired materials.<br><br>Definitions:<br>Roasting – processing of treating (feedstock) at elevated temperatures to obtain oxides. Adapted from ISO 22444-1:2020.<br><br>Calcination – See A33132<br><br>Sintering ¬– thermal treatment of a powder or (material), at a temperature below the melting point of the main constituent, for the purpose of increasing its strength by the metallurgical bonding of its particles. Adapted from ISO 3252:2023.<br><br>Standards/Subcommittees:<br>See A332<br><br>References:<br>Hu, X., Mousa, E., & Ye, G. (2025, February).
