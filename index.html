  <strong>
   Purpose:
  </strong>
  Recovering valuable materials and extending the life of electric vehicle batteries are important steps to address the challenges of supply chain vulnerability and material sourcing difficulties. These recovery pathways are still in their early stages, with many challenges including the broad range of battery chemistries, low resource intensity and process efficiency for lithium recovery in recycling, and safety concerns from material handling.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>
   To facilitate the coordination of battery circularity efforts and research, we introduce a reference model to outline the activities required to recover and treat end-of-life electric vehicle batteries.
  </em>
 </p>
 <p>
  <strong>
   Reference Model:
  </strong>
  The Electric Vehicle Battery (EVB) Recovery Model is adapted from the
  <a href="https://www.nist.gov/services-resources/software/reference-functional-model-production-circular-economy">
   Production in a Circular Economy (CE) Model</a>, which lays out five activities for manufacturing in a CE. This battery recovery model corresponds to the Treat at End of Life (activity A5) of the manufacturing CE model. This model describes the recovery steps within repurposing, remanufacturing, and recycling an EVB. A simplified view of the model can be seen below.

 <p>
  The purpose of this model includes the following:
 </p>
 <ul>
  <li>
   Map out activities to recover electric vehicle batteries at end of use
  </li>
  <li>
   Provide clarity around the technical processes and information needs for battery circularity
  </li>
  <li>
   Facilitate coordination of battery circularity research and development
  </li>
 </ul>
