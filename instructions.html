An IDEF0 model represents a system's functions, activities, and processes (e.g., EV battery recovery). It is a resource for task analysis, understanding complex systems, etc. 
Below are <b>instructions</b> on how to navigate the model, <b>definitions</b> of the modeling structure, and a <b>guide</b> for interpreting the model.

<h2 id="Instructions">Instructions</h2>
Explore the model by clicking the link under the Models section of the sidebar or accessing it from the home page. Navigate through the model by clicking any shaded activity box or link on the page.
There are 3 types of pages: Model, Activity-in-Diagram, and Use of Concept.

<h4>Model pages:</h4>
Model pages consist of diagrams of activities and concepts. The top-level context diagram contains the activity that is the subject of the model (labeled A0). This activity can be decomposed and modeled in a child diagram, and then continue to be decomposed into further child diagrams (A1, A2, ... A11, A12, ... etc.). On model pages, you can click the shaded boxes to navigate into the Activity-in-Diagram. Links to each individual activity or concept page can be accessed under their respective headers on the page. A link to the decomposition of the activity is found under Decomposition. In addition, you can select the shadow of the activity to go directly to the decomposition of the activity.
<h4>Activity-in-Diagram pages:</h4>
Activity-in-Diagram pages describe the selected activity and outline the concepts (input, output, control, mechanism) relevant to the selected activity. From these pages, you can access decompositions of the selected activity (child diagrams) or navigate back to the parent diagram of the activity.
Links to each individual concept page can be accessed under their respective headers on the page.
<h4>Use of Concept pages:</h4>
Use of Concept pages describe the selected concept and provide contextual examples of the concept. They also indicate how the concepts are related to the activities (i.e., inputs, outputs, controls, or mechanisms) and the diagram (i.e., tunneled or not).

<h2 id="Definitions">Definitions</h2>
<b>Activity: </b> A modifying function being modeling within the IDEFâˆ… model.   
<br>
<br>
<b>Concept:</b> Any of the inputs, outputs, mechanisms, or controls (ICOM for short).    
<br>
<br>
<b>Input:</b> Something that is being modified by the activity.

<br>
<b>Output:</b> A result from the activity.  
<div>

<br>
<b>Mechanism:</b> The means and tools employed to complete the activity.

</div>
<br>
<b>Control:</b> The condition required to ensure the correct output is generated. Controls guide, facilitate, or limit the activity.
